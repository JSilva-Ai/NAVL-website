/**
 * A game clip, at the site's standard media size.
 *
 * Every piece of game media on this site is 520×720 — the size VOID STRIKER's
 * canvas is authored at, adopted as the house format so a clip, a screenshot
 * and an empty slot are interchangeable and the grid never reflows when one
 * replaces another. Footage from the private game project uses exactly this
 * size; the ratio is a token so nothing has to remember the numbers.
 *
 * WebM is offered first because it is the smaller of the two and every browser
 * that can decode it should. Safari falls through to H.264.
 *
 * Playback rules, in order of who they are for:
 *   - Reduced motion: the poster, and only the poster. No decoder is created,
 *     no source element is mounted, and the play control is not offered — a
 *     paused video that a visitor has to keep paused is not respect.
 *   - Otherwise the clip is muted, inline, and loops, and starts only when it
 *     is actually on screen. A decoder running for a picture nobody is looking
 *     at costs the same as one somebody is.
