/**
 * Reviews.
 *
 * Built, switched off, and empty — by instruction and by principle. It returns
 * null while `testimonials.enabled` is false, so nothing renders, nothing is
 * announced to a screen reader, and no empty heading is left behind in the
 * document outline.
 *
 * Turning it on is a one-line change in src/content/site.ts. The only thing
 * that belongs in `items` is a review a real person actually wrote — the App
 * Store and Google Play listings are the intended source. Do not write filler
 * here to see how it looks; a fabricated review is a false statement about a
 * customer, and it survives far longer than the afternoon it was convenient.
 *
 * The guard is deliberately belt-and-braces: even if `enabled` were flipped by
 * accident, an empty `items` array still renders nothing.
