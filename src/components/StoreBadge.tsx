 * A store link.

 * These are deliberately *not* imitations of Apple's "Download on the App
 * Store" or Google's "Get it on Google Play" badges. Both are trademarked
 * artwork with published rules about size, clear space, and alteration, and a
 * hand-drawn lookalike breaks those rules while also looking slightly wrong
 * next to the real thing.
 *
 * [TODO] When an app is published, download the official badge for each store
 * from Apple's Marketing Resources and Google Play's Brand Guidelines, drop
 * the SVGs into public/brand/, and swap the markup below for an <img>. The
 * slot is already the right shape and the layout will not move.
 *
 * Until a store href exists, the badge renders as a disabled, non-focusable
 * marker rather than a dead link.
