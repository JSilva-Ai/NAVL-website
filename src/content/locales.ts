/**
 * The locales the site is built to carry, and the one it publishes.
 *
 * Two lists on purpose. `locales` is what the architecture supports; `PUBLISHED`
 * is what actually exists as pages. They are separate because the directive is
 * explicit that no locale goes live until its copy has been reviewed and
 * approved, and the gap between "the code can do this" and "this is public" is
 * exactly where a half-translated site ships by accident.
 *
 * Pages are discovered by walking directories, so a locale becomes public the
 * moment its directory lands on `main`. There is no switch to forget to flip —
 * and none to protect you either. `PUBLISHED` is therefore a statement about
 * what has been approved, checked against the filesystem by the build.
