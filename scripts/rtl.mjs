 *
 * Runs before Arabic exists, and that is the point: the layout has to be
 * direction-agnostic *before* there is content depending on it, or the first
 * Arabic page becomes a bug hunt through a design system nobody has ever seen
 * mirrored.
 *
 * It forces `dir="rtl"` on every sampled component in addition to the native
 * Arabic pages. The checks are about whether the box model was written in
 * physical or logical terms, which is a property of the CSS alone.
 *
 * Why this exists as a permanent suite rather than a one-off: converting the
 * prose list's `padding-left` to `padding-inline-start` while leaving its
 * bullet at `left: calc(...)` pushed /support/ 3px wide in RTL. Nothing was out
 * of bounds, nothing looked wrong in LTR, and the entire existing suite stayed
 * green — because every check in it runs left to right. A one-off sweep found
 * that once. A suite finds the next one.
 *
 * The four checks:
 *
 *   1. Horizontal overflow      the document must not be wider than the viewport
 *   2. Out-of-bounds elements   nothing may hang past either edge
 *   3. Mirror symmetry          an element's distance from the start edge should
 *                               be the same in both directions — this is what
 *                               catches a physical property that did not flip
 *   4. Directional icons        the "opens elsewhere" arrow must point the other
 *                               way, since it is a glyph and glyphs do not mirror
 *                               themselves
