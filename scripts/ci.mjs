/**
 * The checks, exactly as CI runs them.
 *
 *   npm run ci
 *
 * One definition for local and hosted checks. `npm run ci` runs every suite
 * sequentially; .github/workflows/checks.yml uses --only to run the same
 * suites in parallel jobs so their combined runtime does not hit one timeout.
 *
 * That is not a hypothetical tidiness. The head refactor shipped a 404 on every
 * page under a subpath and CI caught it on the merge, because CI builds at
 * BASE_PATH=/NAVL-website/ and every local run had been at "/". The workflow even
 * said why in a comment. Reading a comment is not a mechanism; running the same
 * script is.
 *
 * A second trap is closed here too. Reproducing that failure by hand the first
 * time, BASE_PATH was set on the build but not on `vite preview` — so the server
 * came up at "/", every subpath request fell through to the SPA fallback, and
 * the home page's chunks 404'd. It looks exactly like the real bug and is not
 * it. Here the base is computed once and passed to both.
 *
 * Flags:
 *   --base=/          build and serve at a different base (default /NAVL-website/,
 *                     which is what a GitHub Pages project site deploys to)
 *   --skip-build      reuse the dist already on disk
 *   --only=a11y|qa    run one suite
 *   --port=4173
