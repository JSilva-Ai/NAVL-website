# New AI Vision Labs

The website for New AI Vision Labs — an independent app studio publishing to
the App Store and Google Play.

---

## Running it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev            # http://localhost:5173
npm run build          # tsc -b && vite build
npm run preview        # serve dist/ on :4173
```

React, Vite, and hand-written CSS. No CSS framework, no animation library, no
router, no 3D library.

## Structure

This is a **multi-page build**, not a single-page app. Every route is its own
HTML document with its own `<title>`, description, canonical, and entry module.

That is a deployment decision rather than a stylistic one. On a static host an
SPA serves unknown paths from the 404 document, and GitHub Pages returns it
with a real 404 status. `/privacy`, `/terms`, `/support` and `/data-deletion`
are URLs Apple and Google reviewers open directly, and a legal page that
answers 404 is a rejected listing. Real files answer 200.

```
index.html                 → src/pages/home.tsx
apps/index.html            → src/pages/apps.tsx
apps/<slug>/               → src/pages/app-<slug>.tsx   (one per product)
demo/                      → src/pages/demo.tsx
support/  privacy/  terms/  data-deletion/
```

`vite.config.ts` discovers every `index.html` in the project, so adding a route
means adding a directory — there is no list to keep in sync. `public/sitemap.xml`
*is* a list, and does need updating. The one directory it skips is `mobile/`,
which holds three more copies of the game's own `index.html` and no routes.

```
src/
  content/
    site.ts        studio, nav, home, apps, demo, testimonials, footer
    legal.ts       privacy policy and terms
    help.ts        support and data deletion
  components/      one component per unit; nav.css and hero.css sit beside theirs
  lib/
    perceptionField.ts   the home hero's WebGL2 point cloud
    url.ts               internal links and public assets, resolved against BASE_URL
    hooks.ts             reveal, media query, pointer, scroll
  pages/           one entry per route
  styles/          tokens, base, ui, sections
mobile/
  void-striker/    the game packaged for iOS and Android with Capacitor —
                   a separate npm project; see its own README
scripts/
  shoot.mjs        screenshots every route across six viewports
  a11y.mjs         axe-core + keyboard walk + touch-target audit
  perf.mjs         Core Web Vitals, transfer weight, measured frame rate
  render/brand.mjs regenerates og.jpg and the app tile from the mark
```

## Adding a product

1. Add an entry to `apps` in `src/content/site.ts`. `category` puts it in the
   applications or the games group — `portfolio` derives both from the array,
   so there is no second list to update. `status` is one of four stages, and
   `platforms` is optional: leave it off rather than guessing at iOS and
   Android for something too early to have decided.
2. Copy `apps/void-striker/index.html` to `apps/<slug>/index.html` and update
   its title, description, and canonical.
3. Copy `src/pages/app-void-striker.tsx` to `src/pages/app-<slug>.tsx`, change
   the slug, and point the new HTML at it.
4. Add the route to `public/sitemap.xml` and to `ROUTES` in `scripts/shoot.mjs`.

Screenshots go in `public/media/apps/<slug>/` and are listed on the app entry.

## The identity

The mark is an **NAI monogram**: the N drawn whole, the A set so its left arm
crosses the N's right stem with its apex carried above the N's cap height. That
overhang is the peak — the letters interlock rather than standing side by side.
The i's tittle is the sphere, and it is the only filled element and the only
one carrying the blue.

Three files hold the same geometry and must move together:

| | |
|---|---|
| `src/assets/logo.svg` | standalone asset, explicit colours |
| `src/components/Logo.tsx` | inline, inherits `currentColor` |
| `scripts/render/brand.mjs` | rasterised for `og.jpg` and the app tile |

`public/favicon.svg` is deliberately *not* the same drawing. It is a reduction
— the peak and the sphere only — because at 16px each of three letters gets
about four pixels and the result is a grey smudge.

Palette and type live in `src/styles/tokens.css`: `#050507` ground, `#0A84FF →
#1E6FFF` primary, `#C8CDD4` chrome for the second voice, pure white body copy.
Headings are heavy and condensed on Archivo's width axis (`wdth` 76, `wght`
800) rather than by transform — scaling a letterform horizontally thins its
horizontals unevenly.

## Game media

**Every piece of game media on this site is 520×720.** That is the size VOID
STRIKER's canvas is authored at, adopted as the house format: a clip, a
screenshot and an empty slot are then interchangeable, and a grid never reflows
when one replaces another. The size lives in `--media-w` / `--media-h` /
`--media-ratio` in `tokens.css`.
The width is a cap rather than a fixed size — it has to shrink on a 320px
phone — but the ratio always holds.

`GameClip.tsx` is the one component that fills the slot. Under reduced motion
it renders the poster and nothing else: no decoder, no source elements, no play
control to argue with.

The gameplay clip and poster are published under `public/media/games/void-striker/`.
The editable game source, original art, and iOS/Android projects live in the
private `JSilva-Ai/void-striker` repository. This public repository contains
only marketing media and site pages. `/demo/` shows the clip; the former
playable URL redirects to the product page. Generate new footage from the
private project and copy only the finished media into this site.

## The hero

`src/lib/perceptionField.ts` renders a WebGL2 point cloud. Points at rest are
achromatic; points that have returned run the mark's blue, and the deeper blue
appears in the mid band as a depth cue — the same gradient as the sphere.

It is ornament, it is confined to the home page, and it makes no claim. If the
GPU cannot run it or the visitor prefers reduced motion, the page loses a
texture and nothing else.

## Checks

```bash
npm run ci            # everything CI runs, at the base CI runs it at
npm run ci -- --skip-build   # reuse the dist on disk
npm run ci -- --only=a11y    # one suite (a11y | qa | rtl)
```

`scripts/ci.mjs` **is** what `.github/workflows/checks.yml` runs, rather than a
local approximation of it. That is the only arrangement where "it passed
locally" and "it passed CI" mean the same thing, and it is here because both
halves of that sentence had already been false once: the workflow's
hand-written accessibility route list went on checking eight routes months
after there were thirteen, and a base-path bug reached `main` because every
local run had been at `/` while CI builds at `/NAVL-website/`.

It builds at `BASE_PATH=/NAVL-website/`, **passes the same base to the preview
server**, refuses to run if the server comes up anywhere else, reads the route
list off the build rather than from a list someone maintains, and then runs the
accessibility, visual and RTL suites over it.

The base matters. Production builds at the domain root because `public/CNAME`
is present, so testing at `/` would leave every base-relative URL — which is
all of them, since links go through `lib/url.ts` — untested in the harder of
the two configurations.

The individual suites, if you want one on its own:

```bash
node scripts/a11y.mjs  --url=…   # axe-core, keyboard walk, target sizes
node scripts/shoot.mjs --url=…   # screenshots; console, request and overflow checks
node scripts/rtl.mjs   --url=…   # right-to-left regression coverage
npm run qa:perf                  # Core Web Vitals, informational
```

### Right-to-left coverage

`scripts/rtl.mjs` forces `dir="rtl"` on a site whose only published locale is
English. The Latin text then reads oddly, which does not matter: none of what it
checks is about language. It renders each route in both directions and compares
them.

- the document must not be wider than the viewport
- nothing may hang past either edge
- **an element's distance from the start edge must be the same in both
  directions** — this is the check that catches a physical property that did not
  flip, and it is scoped to elements whose width did not change, because a
  different width means the text wrapped differently and the comparison would be
  measuring the wrap
- the `↗` arrow must be mirrored, since a glyph does not mirror itself

It exists as a permanent suite rather than a one-off because a one-off already
found one: converting a list's `padding-left` to `padding-inline-start` while
leaving its bullet at `left: calc(…)` pushed `/support/` three pixels wide in
RTL. Nothing was out of bounds, nothing looked wrong left-to-right, and the
whole suite stayed green — because every check in it ran left-to-right.

Deliberate exceptions are listed in `EXEMPT` at the top of the script, with the
reason. Today that is the home page's phone mockup: a phone's side button is on
the right of the device whichever way the language on its screen reads.

### Screenshot coverage by locale

`scripts/shoot.mjs` sweeps the default locale in full — thirteen routes across
six viewports — and a translated locale as a sample: five routes at two
viewports, chosen because between them they carry every component on the site.

That is deliberate arithmetic. Four locales swept the way English is would be
312 screenshots a run, and a suite slow enough to skip catches nothing. What
differs in a translation is text — its length, its wrapping, its direction — and
that breaks a layout at the narrowest width first.

```bash
node scripts/shoot.mjs --locales=en          # default
node scripts/shoot.mjs --locales=en,pt       # once /pt/ exists
```

The run prints which locales it covered and at what depth, so a green result is
never mistaken for more coverage than it was.

## Deploying

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` publishes to GitHub Pages from `main`, which is
named literally in the workflow — see the comment at the top of that file for
why following `repository.default_branch` is a trap. `base` is configurable
because the same build serves from a domain root and from a subpath:

```bash
npm run build                        # domain root
BASE_PATH=/NAVL-website/ npm run build  # GitHub Pages project site
```

The workflow resolves this itself: a `public/CNAME` means a custom domain and
the site builds for the root, otherwise it builds for `/<repo>/`. Internal
links and runtime-built asset URLs go through `src/lib/url.ts`, which resolves
them against `BASE_URL` — Vite cannot rewrite those for you.

### The domain

`public/CNAME` names `newaivisionlabs.com`, so the deploy publishes there and
the build switches to the domain root. Everything else in the site was already
written for that domain — every canonical URL, `public/sitemap.xml`,
`public/robots.txt` and the manifest's `start_url` all say
`https://newaivisionlabs.com/`, and they are simply wrong for as long as the
site is served from the `github.io` subpath instead.

This is done — the domain resolves to Pages and the site serves from it. What
follows is the record of how, because it is the part that is easy to get
backwards.

**The DNS has to be pointed before the CNAME reaches `main`.** With a CNAME in
the artifact, GitHub Pages sets the custom domain and redirects the `github.io`
URL to it. If the domain is not pointed at Pages yet, that redirect leads to
whatever the registrar is still serving — so publishing the CNAME first takes
the working site *down* rather than moving it.

At the registrar, four `A` records on the apex and one `CNAME` on `www`:

```
@      A       185.199.108.153
@      A       185.199.109.153
@      A       185.199.110.153
@      A       185.199.111.153
www    CNAME   jsilva-ai.github.io.
```

`AAAA` records for the same four hosts are optional and can be added later.

Deleting the apex `A` record at Hostinger also removed the existing `www`
CNAME, so `www` had to be created rather than edited. Check for it by name
after any change to that zone — a missing `www` is invisible until someone
types it.

**Change only those records.** Do not switch nameservers and do not use any
"reset/clear DNS" or "connect a website" button the registrar offers: those
rewrite the whole zone, which takes the `MX`, `SPF` and `DMARC` records with
them, and support email stops being delivered without anything appearing to
break.

Then, once the records resolve: merge to `main`, wait for the deploy, and turn
on **Settings → Pages → Enforce HTTPS** after GitHub has issued the
certificate. It cannot be enabled until the domain resolves to Pages, and a
store reviewer opening an `http://` link that does not redirect is a bad first
impression of a company.

## The business address question

The site **publishes the operator's home address**, in `site.postalAddress` and
in the privacy policy's "Who we are". That was decided deliberately, with the
alternatives priced and the consequence stated, and it is recorded here so that
nobody later mistakes it for something that slipped through.

The reasoning that made it a real choice rather than a default: withholding the
address from this site would not have kept it private, because a store listing
publishes one anyway.

- **Google Play.** The developer address is shown on the store listing, is
  verified by Google, and cannot be suppressed. A USPS PO box is refused. A
  street address from a mailbox service or a registered agent is accepted.
- **Offering the apps in the EU.** Apple publishes trader details — name,
  address, phone, email — under the Digital Services Act, and the GDPR expects
  the controller's address in the privacy notice itself.

If that trade-off is ever revisited, the routes in Georgia, cheapest first:

1. **A commercial mailbox with a street address** (a CMRA — the UPS Store and
   similar). Roughly $10–30/month, accepted by Google Play because it is a
   street address rather than a PO box.
2. **A registered agent's address**, if the studio is or becomes an LLC.
   Agents run $50–150/year.

Switching is a one-line change to `site.postalAddress` plus the matching
sentence in the privacy policy's "Who we are", and then the same address in
the Play Console and App Store Connect. Nothing else reads it.

### The entity

**New AI Vision Labs LLC** — a Georgia limited liability company, registered
with the Secretary of State, holding an EIN issued in that name.

That matters in three places in this repo:

- `site.legalName` is the entity and appears in the privacy policy, the terms,
  and the copyright line. `site.name` is the trading name and is what the site
  says everywhere it is talking to a visitor rather than to a lawyer.
- The terms name Georgia as the governing law, which is where the entity is
  formed. Those now agree, which they must.
- The liability cap in the terms is still `[TODO]` and is now worth setting
  properly, because there is an entity for it to protect.

**The EIN is not in this repo and must never be.** It is required nowhere on a
website and is useful to anyone attempting fraud in the company's name. The
same is true of the formation documents.

One thing worth checking outside this repo: a Georgia LLC's registered agent
and registered office address are public record on the Secretary of State's
searchable database. If the home address was used there, it is already public
independently of this website, and switching to a commercial registered agent
(around $50–150/year) is what takes it off that record.

## Before this goes public

- **Every `[TODO]` marker is visible on the live page.** That is deliberate.
  `src/content/legal.ts` and `src/content/help.ts` are honest templates, not
  finished policy — nothing in them asserts what any app collects, because that
  is a fact about software that has to be checked rather than guessed. Have a
  lawyer read the privacy policy and terms before publishing.
- **VOID STRIKER's store plan is undecided, and the site says so.** Platforms
  read `Browser` only, and the copy states no release date rather than one that
  would move. Screenshots are still to come.
- The canonical URLs and the sitemap point at `newaivisionlabs.com` while the
  build is served from GitHub Pages. That is intended — the domain is owned and
  not yet pointed at the site.

## Conventions worth knowing

- **Text stops at `--chrome-dim`.** `--chrome-faint` and below are under 4.5:1
  on the ground and are reserved for rules, dots, and disabled marks.
- **The blue is a signal.** It marks the one thing on a screen being offered.
  If two things glow, neither reads as important.
- **Reviews are built, switched off, and empty.** `Testimonials.tsx` renders
  nothing until there are real store reviews to put in it. Do not write filler
  there to see how it looks.
- **Reduced motion is a layout, not a fallback.** Every page is designed to be
  complete with all animation disabled.
